# Introduction

This project is an advanced Password Strength Meter, developed to help users create secure and reliable passwords. It is designed with a strong focus on user guidance and security best practices. The tool evaluates the strength of user-inputted passwords in real-time and offers actionable feedback to help users improve weak credentials. It goes beyond simple validation by using a scoring system and checking passwords against common weak ones, ensuring users are better protected from potential breaches.

# Key Features
### ✅ Minimum Length Enforcement:
Validates that the password is at least 8 characters long, aligning with standard security recommendations.

### ✅ Character Case Verification:
Ensures the presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters, making passwords more complex and difficult to crack.

### ✅ Numeric Character Check:
Requires the inclusion of at least one digit (0–9) to add variety and strength.

### ✅ Special Character Requirement:
Validates that the password includes at least one special character (e.g., @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, <, >, |, !, ?, /) to resist dictionary attacks.

### ✅ Password Scoring System:
An intelligent scoring mechanism that classifies passwords into categories such as Weak, Moderate, or Strong based on their composition.

### ✅ Real-Time Feedback & Suggestions:
Offers dynamic suggestions on what is missing (e.g., “Add a digit” or “Use a special character”) to help users actively strengthen their passwords.

### ✅ Common Password Detection:
Compares the entered password against a curated list of common or compromised passwords and alerts users if their input is too predictable or insecure.


# Tech Stack
### Python:
The core programming language used to implement all logic, rules, and validation mechanisms.

### Streamlit:
A powerful Python framework used to build an interactive and user-friendly web interface for real-time password analysis and feedback.
